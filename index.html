				<p>Amsterdam is the capital and most populous city of the Netherlands. Found within the province of
					North Holland,
					Amsterdam is colloquially referred to as the "Venice of the North", attributed by the large number
					of canals.

					Amsterdam's name derives from Amstelredamme, indicative of the city's origin around a dam in the
					river Amstel.
					Originating as a small fishing village in the late 12th century, Amsterdam became one of the most
					important ports in the world in the
					Dutch Golden Age of the 17th century and became the leading centre for finance and trade.
				</p>
				<p>In the 19th and 20th centuries, the city expanded, and many new neighbourhoods and suburbs were
					planned and built.
					The 17th-century canals of Amsterdam and the 19–20th century Defence Line of Amsterdam are on the
					UNESCO World Heritage List.
					Sloten, annexed in 1921 by the municipality of Amsterdam, is the oldest part of the city, dating to
					the 9th century.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the commercial capital of the Netherlands and one of the top financial centres in Europe,
					Amsterdam is considered an alpha-world city by the Globalization and World Cities study group. T
					he city is also the cultural capital of the Netherlands.
					Also, many of the world's largest companies are based in Amsterdam or have established their
					European headquarters in the city.
				</p>
				<p>In 2012, Amsterdam was ranked the second best city to live in by the Economist Intelligence Unit and
					12th globally on quality of living for environment and infrastructure by Mercer. The city was ranked
					4th place globally as top tech hub in the Savills Tech Cities 2019 report (2nd in Europe), and 3rd
					in innovation by Australian innovation agency 2thinknow in their Innovation Cities Index 2009. The
					Port of Amsterdam is the fifth largest in Europe. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is the busiest airport
					in the Netherlands, and the third busiest in Europe. Famous Amsterdam residents include the diarist
					Anne Frank, artists Rembrandt and Van Gogh, and philosopher Baruch Spinoza.

			<article>
				<h3>Neighbourhood Bos&lommer</h3>

				<p>
					There’s a lot to see, buy and do in the hip and diverse neighbourhood of Bos en Lommer and De
					Baarsjes. Eateries, cafes, unique lodgings and one of the best green spaces in the city, all make
					this neighbourhood well worth your time.

				</p>
				<p><b>Spend the night in a tram cart, or rubbing shoulders with artists</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					If the last room you slept in was boring, we highly recommend sleeping in a tram cart, or behind a
					secret bookcase. Hotel Not Hotel offers those and a dozen other unique not-rooms, like the mini
					Spanish villa or the elevated crow’s nest, as well as an awesome food and cocktail bar called Kevin
					Bacon.

				</p>
				<p><b>Watch a gig or stage performance, then dance the night away</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Single-function destinations sometimes just don’t cut it. Sometimes, you just can’t put your finger
					on the type of entertainment you need. De Marktkantine – once a canteen for food-market workers –
					houses a theatre, club and restaurant, and has an excellent events schedule. You might also want to
					check out De School, another cultural and clubbing hub with its own strong line-up of events.
					<img src="img/stageperformance.png" title="stage performance" width="400" height="240"
					alt="performance stage">
				</p>	

				<p><b>Stare at people (or the clouds) from a beautiful terrace bar</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					For a calmer evening, consider heading to a terrace bar and quietly enjoying some good food and
					pedestrian action.
					If you’re a wine lover, Partisan has an excellent selection on offer, as well as hearty dishes and
					modern bistro fare.
					For a vintage pub vibe (plus a huge green couch) head to Bar Spek and try some fresh soup and pizza
					while you’re there.
					And just as vintage – this one is housed in a former jeweller school – but sometimes a bit louder,
					Lokaal Edel serves a strong line-up of burgers and tartare for your carnivorous pleasure.
					All three, of course, have fantastic outdoor spaces.
					<img src="img/terracebar.png" title="terrace bar" width="400" height="240" alt="terrace bar">
				</p>
				<p><b>Eat your way through the Jan Evertsenstraat</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					The Jan Evertsenstraat is a great street to lose a few hours in. And when you’re done with the
					shopping and walking, you’ll also find several top-notch eateries to duck into. For burgers and
					beer, you can’t go wrong with the cosy, reasonably-priced Frits. If you’re looking for something
					more sophisticated, then the super-stylish Café Zurich should be your first port of call. And for
					just coffee – stellar coffee mind – then White Label Coffee serves up some imported beans, which you
					can buy by the cup or in beautiful bags.
				</p>
				<p><b>Recharge in a neighbourhood park</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Sunshine (when available), sculptures and open lakes, families, kids and pets: the sprawling
					Rembrandt Park is one of the top outdoor spots in the city. It’s sometimes quiet, sometimes loud,
					but always beautiful to walk through and perfect to relax in. The park has plenty of amenities too,
					including exercise areas and a very popular petting zoo. Alternatively, head to Erasmus Park to
					wander the expansive flower gardens and relax with a coffee in Terrasmus cafe.
				</p>

					In the Rickson Gracie Jiu Jitsu they find it important that the techniques that teach actually work
					"on the street" and only teach proven and tested techniques. As far as we are concerned, the best
					option is to try and avoid a confrontation.
					But when it comes down to it, you will be able to "stand your ground."
